There is no single key to scientific knowledge, discovery and understanding. But great tools can help make the path to those goals be much more efficient. Axiom Data Science designs and builds web-based software to explore data and increase its overall impact.

As a researcher finding data quickly is the first step, assessing whether it will meet your needs is the next. A well-managed catalog of data sets should be easy to browse and search without a priori knowledge of specific, defined keywords, it should provide robust metadata, and it should provide direct access to the data. We build these from your existing archive.

Diving into a dataset is the quickest way to find out if it's worth pursuing quantitative analysis. We build intuitive visualization tools that allow users interactively explore diverse datasets through time, depth and space (higher dimensions too) and extract the data they need. Built in HTML5 and javascript, our applications allow anyone to jump right into satellite data or model results without having to download specialized software or be an expert in Matlab or Fledermaus.

We won't interpret your data for you, but we will help you prepare it for yourself or others to understand what it is trying to say. Meaningful plots, graphs and maps aren't just for publications and promotional websites, they are essential to breaking new intellectual ground.
