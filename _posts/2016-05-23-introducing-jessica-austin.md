We are pleased to announce the addition of a new Senior Software Engineer to the <a href="http://axiomdatascience.com/about/">Axiom team</a> - welcome aboard Jessica Austin! Jessica has a background in math, physics, mechanical engineering, and control systems from Caltech and Carnegie Mellon where she worked on robotics. She was also a software developer and development/operations engineer at ThoughtWorks and GrubHub. At Axiom, she's helping us reinvent how our backend systems store, serve, and monitor our big data holdings. This will help harden our software infrastructure to make it more scalable and reliable, and ultimately increase the speed of data access through our clients' web-based tools.
