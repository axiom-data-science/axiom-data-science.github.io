Axiom Data Science and UAF's [Fresh Eyes on Ice project](http://fresheyesonice.org/) have teamed up to provide a citizen science tool for sharing river ice observations. The National Weather Service River Forecast Desk, recognizing the value of these observations, are receiving these observations immediately so that their forecasting desk has best-available information during break up season.

Read more about [Axiom Ice Observation tool](https://news.uaf.edu/scientists-forecasters-ask-alaskans-for-river-breakup-information/) or [create your own observation](https://obs.feoi.axds.co/observations/new). Approved observations will be added to a map layer in the Axiom-created [Fresh Eyes on Ice data portal](https://feoi.axds.co/).

Axiom Data Science congratulates UAF's Fresh Eyes on Ice program on providing up-to-the minute quality ice data observations to the public, and Fairbanks forecasters.
