Accessing, visualizing, and integrating data from the NSF <a href="https://oceanobservatories.org/"> Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) </a> into research and classrooms is a whole lot easier. The Ocean Observatories Initiative launched its new data exploration tool – OOI Data Explorer version 1.0 on 5 October <a href=" https://dataexplorer.oceanobservatories.org"> https://dataexplorer.oceanobservatories.org </a> . Data Explorer allows users to search and download cabled, uncabled, and recovered data, compare datasets across regions and disciplines, generate and share custom data views, and download full data sets using ERDDAP.

The OOI Data Team worked with Axiom Data Science to develop a data exploration system that is both powerful and user friendly. Version 1.0 has already been beta tested over the past three months by a subset of OOI scientific data users. This group’s feedback has improved Data Explorer, making it ready for broader distribution and use.

A live demonstration of Data Explorer is scheduled for 21 October at 2 pm EDT. This timeframe will allow users to try their hands using Data Explorer and come to the demonstration ready with specific questions about accessing data or suggestions on functions that could further enhance the user experience.

“Data Explorer version 1.0 is the culmination of  a process of listening to OOI data users and responding by implementing easier, more efficient, and useful means to deliver OOI data to them,” explained Jeffrey Glatstein, head of OOI’s Cyberinfrastructure, who guided a team of data and visualization experts in developing the tool. “It is an excellent tool that has been refined over the test period, and which we will continue to refine it in response to users’ suggestions. While continued improvements will be made and more data continually added, Data Explorer version 1.0 offers a great new way to find, access, and use OOI data.”

To ensure that all OOI data users maintain access to data, OOI’s current <a href="https://ooinet.oceanobservatories.org/"> data portal </a> will remain accessible and functional until the foreseeable future.  Once all data have been exported to Data Explorer, tested, and vetted, only then will a complete switch be made to this new innovative tool.

The developers caution that Data Explorer version 1.0 may still have a few bugs, and users are asked to report them so the tool can be improved.

Added Glatstein, “Data Explorer is really a community-driven tool and it will be exciting to see how we can refine and improve it to meet the needs of our community.”
