**Reloads:** The ingestion system was redesigned and updated to support an automated solution for re-processing instrument data when configuration, quality control, or system changes occur. 

**Staging site:** To safely test changes to support reloads and other OOI goals, Axiom Data Science deployed a staging environment that mimics the production environment. 

**Staging Environment**: A new deployment environment was designed and implemented. The new staging environment provides an infrastructure similar to production to allow for safe testing of changes and new integrations without impacting the public-facing site and our user base.
