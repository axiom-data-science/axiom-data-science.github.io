### Release Summary
Since its inaugural launch in October 2020, OOI has been working with users of Data Explorer to learn what features worked for them, which could be improved, and what could be added to optimize usersâ€™ experiences.  This input has been put into practice and is now available for further testing on Data Explorer v1.1.

#### Important: #### 
As it is still in the development stage, the Data Explorer v1.0 can be unstable and you may experience a few minor problems, known as bugs. Additionally, only a subset of the OOI data streams are available. This is expected and you will see placeholders (gray boxes) where additional data are forthcoming.
