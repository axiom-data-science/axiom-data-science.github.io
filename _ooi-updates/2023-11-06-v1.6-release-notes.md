### Release Summary
Version 1.6 of the Data Explorer offers a beta version of the HD video in the media server, provides additional differentiation between the Axial Seamount and Oregon Margin Regional Cabled Array Assest, adds Human In The Loop (HITL) flags, and adds two ADCP instruments to the Data Explorer. 

### New Features and Bug Fixes

#### Data Sets

Two ADCP instruments have been added. These two instruments are the first two full-resolution Regional Cabled Array (RCA) ADPCs ingested into the OOI Data Explorer and provide high-resolution current meter data. Not all of the data are available yet as they are still being ingested.

#### Beta: HD Video Streams

A beta version of HD video streams are now available on the Data Explorer. Video files are represented as a high-speed preview of the entire video. Users can scrub back and forth to locate events of interest. Access video [here](https://dataexplorer.oceanobservatories.org/#ooi/media/RS03ASHS-PN03B-06-CAMHDA301?t=video).

#### Human In The Loop quality control flags
Human In The Loop quality control flags are now included for all appropriately annotated data. Data will need to be reingested before the flags will be available and ingestion is ongoing for instruments of particular interest. The below shows an HITL flag example.
