# New features and updates:

**ADCP data integration:** ADCP data within OOI processed into a format optimized for visualization and distribution as a 2-D multi-stage binned product stored in a Zarr multi-dimensional array. The output data are visualized and served through [OOI Data Explorer](https://dataexplorer.oceanobservatories.org/#ooi/array/CE/subsite/CE02SHBP/node/CE02SHBP-LJ?sort=end_date_desc&instrument_id=CE02SHBP-LJ01D-05-ADCPTB104). The OOI Data Explorer includes support for QARTOD flags associated with ADCP data as well as support for downloads. The integration improves performance and resolution of ADCP data.

**Reloads stabilization:** Significant improvements were made to improve automation of full-data reloads and to improve stability of reloads. Improved system monitoring now supports detecting problems with reload attempts before a reload request is processed by Data Explorer subsystems. The majority of reloads can be processed without direct human monitoring or human intervention. Improvements in the integration of the system allow for operators to queue large batches of reload requests and monitor the status of entire batches at a time.

**ZPLS metadata updates:** Raw data download endpoints are now available in the [OOI Data Explorer](https://dataexplorer.oceanobservatories.org/#ooi/array/CE/subsite/CE02SHBP/node/CE02SHBP-LJ?sort=end_date_desc&instrument_id=CE02SHBP-LJ01D-05-ADCPTB104). 

**Annotation service updates:** The updates to the annotations service now account for deployments with no stream data. 

**Hydrophone data processing, ingests, and visualizations:** Created a proof of concept workflow for processing hydrophone data using PyPAM software. 

**Improvements to Metadata and Presentation of Information:** Many instruments benefitted from improved metadata and communication of information through units, annotations, public notices, value scaling, and others.

**Security:** Incorporated automatic docker image scans to identify security vulnerabilities before deployment.
